## The Blu-ray Drive 

I ordered this [LG 4K UHD Blu-ray drive](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079LTC6ML/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1), but not all 4K and Blu-ray drives are made equally. Blu-ray actuall has some encryptions built in that prevent users from ripping movies from them, because of course they do. If you just want to do DVD, then I believe any old drive will work, but who wants to just do DVDs? MakeMKV is, as far as I know, the only software that will do what we want, and while it is free, it limits you to like 5 per month or something. The MakeMKV forums have a list of drives that are approved, because yes, there are approved ones that you have to jailbreak. That's right, you have to jailbreak your blu-ray drive to get it to do the de-encryption. The list is [here](https://forum.makemkv.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=19634). 

By jailbreaking, I mean flashing a particular firmware that I don't remember being too hard to do. If I remember right, you just download the software, which is in the link above, and you can do it in MakeMKV.
